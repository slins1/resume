    <!-- Summary/Objective Statement -->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Spencer Linsner, a tech support specialist living in southeastern
      Wisconsin. As my work history shows, I've spent nearly 10 years working in
      various support positions in several different industries, but I've always
      retained the love for programming and the creativity that comes with it
      since my time in college.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm pursuing that passion and focusing on building my skill and
      portfolio as a full-stack web developer. This site will begin as a simple
      resume, but it's my goal that over time, it becomes an exhibition of my
      new abilities in the form of actual website projects. I look forward to
      bringing you with me on this journey, so keep checking in!
